# TOML Filter Writing Guide

OMNI supports user-defined TOML filters for distilling output from any command — including internal company tools, custom deploy scripts, and CI pipelines.

## Filter Location

| Directory | Priority | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Built-in (compiled) | Lowest | Ships with OMNI |
| `~/.omni/filters/` | Medium | User-global filters |
| `.omni/filters/` | Highest | Project-local (requires `omni trust`) |

Project-local filters override user filters which override built-in filters.

## Basic Structure

```toml
schema_version = 1

[filters.my_filter]
description = "What this filter does"
match_command = "^my-tool\\b"           # Regex matching command output
strip_ansi = true                       # Remove ANSI color codes first
confidence = 0.85                       # Base confidence score (0.0-1.0)

# Output matchers (first match wins)
[[filters.my_filter.match_output]]
pattern = "Deployment successful"       # Regex match on output
message = "deploy: ✓ success"           # Replacement message
unless = "ROLLBACK"                     # Skip if this pattern also appears

# Line filters
strip_lines_matching = ["^\\[DEBUG\\]", "^Waiting"]
keep_lines_matching  = []               # Mutually exclusive with strip

max_lines = 30                          # Maximum output lines
on_empty = "my_filter: completed"       # Fallback if everything is stripped

# Inline tests
[[tests.my_filter]]
name = "strips debug lines"
input = """
[DEBUG] Connecting...
Deployment successful
"""
expected = "deploy: ✓ success"
```

## Real-World Examples

    "^\\[DEBUG\\]",
    "^Uploading artifact",
    "^Waiting for health check",
    "^\\s*\\d+%",

## Filter Fields Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `description` | String | No | Human-readable description |
| `match_command` | Regex | No | Match against command text |
| `strip_ansi` | Bool | No | Remove ANSI codes before processing |
| `confidence` | Float | No | Base confidence score (0.0-1.0) |
| `strip_lines_matching` | \[Regex\] | No | Lines matching these patterns are removed |
| `keep_lines_matching` | \[Regex\] | No | Only keep lines matching these (exclusive with strip) |
| `max_lines` | Int | No | Maximum output lines |
| `on_empty` | String | No | Fallback output if everything stripped |

### Match Output Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pattern` | Regex | Match against output content |
| `message` | String | Replacement message (supports `$1`, `$2` capture groups) |
| `unless` | Regex | Skip this match if unless-pattern also matches |

## Testing Your Filters

```bash
# Verify all loaded filters pass inline tests
omni learn --verify

# Dry-run pattern detection on a log file
omni learn --dry-run < output.log

# Apply detected patterns to learned.toml
omni learn --apply < output.log
```

## Trust for Project Filters

Project-local filters (`.omni/filters/`) are not loaded until trusted:

```bash
omni trust    # Review and trust current project's filters
omni doctor   # Shows trust status
```
