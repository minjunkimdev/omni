> **The Semantic Signal Engine that cuts AI token consumption by up to 90%.**<br/>
> OMNI acts as a context-aware terminal interceptor—distilling noisy command outputs in real-time into high-density intelligence, ensuring your LLM agents work with **meaning**, not text waste.

---

## Why OMNI?

When Claude runs `git diff`, `cargo test`, or `kubectl get pods`, it receives **everything** — every "Compiling..." line, every cached Docker layer, every passing test. This noise consumes tokens, dilutes reasoning, and slows your agent down.

Most filters work by **rules**: strip lines matching patterns. OMNI works by **meaning**:

- It **understands** that `error[E0432]` matters more than `Compiling foo v0.1.0`
- It **knows your session** — boosting files you're actively editing
- It **never drops** — compressed content is always retrievable via `omni_retrieve()`

### The Impact
> **Reduce up to 90% AI Token Usage**  
> *Zero Information Loss. Maximum Agent Context. <2ms Overhead.*
<br/>

![OMNI Token Savings](omni_token_savings_graphic.png)



## How It Works

1. **Classify** — OMNI identifies the content type (git diff, build output, test results, logs) by analyzing structure, not filenames
2. **Score** — Each line gets a semantic relevance score based on signal tier (critical → noise) and your current session context
3. **Compose** — High-signal content is kept, noise is removed, and anything dropped is stored in RewindStore for retrieval

All of this happens **transparently** — your AI agent doesn't know OMNI exists. It just gets better signal.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
brew tap fajarhide/omni
brew install omni

# Setup Claude Code hooks (one-time)
omni init --hook

# Verify
omni doctor

# View token savings after your first session
omni stats
```

Or install via script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fajarhide/omni/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
omni init --hook
```

## What Gets Distilled?

| Content Type | Example Command | Typical Reduction | What's Kept |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Git Diff** | `git diff HEAD~3` | 56-80% | File tree, changed hunks, +/- lines |
| **Git Status** | `git status` | 70-80% | Branch, staged/modified/untracked summary |
| **Build Output** | `cargo build` | 65-85% | Error count, error messages, warnings |
| **Test Results** | `pytest`, `cargo test` | 70-90% | Pass/fail count, failure details |
| **Infrastructure** | `kubectl get pods` | 60-75% | Pod status summary, non-running details |
| **Docker** | `docker build .` | 70-85% | Step count, cache hits, image ID |
| **Logs** | access logs, app logs | 0-40% | Errors, warnings, anomalies |

### Before & After

**`docker build .`** — 15 lines → 1 line (81% reduction)
```

# After (what Claude sees with OMNI):

```

## Session Continuity

OMNI doesn't just compress — it **understands your session context**.

When you're debugging `src/auth/mod.rs`, OMNI:
- **Boosts** any output mentioning `auth/mod.rs` (because it's a hot file)
- **Prioritizes** errors matching patterns you've seen before
- **Infers** your task domain ("auth module") for smarter scoring
- **Persists** across compaction events, so Claude never loses context

This is powered by the `SessionState` engine that tracks hot files, recent commands, active errors, and domain hints — all stored in local SQLite.

## RewindStore — Never Drop, Always Retrievable

When OMNI compresses aggressively, the original content isn't deleted — it's stored in the **RewindStore** with a SHA-256 hash:

```
[omni: 1,247 chars stored → omni_retrieve("a1b2c3d4")]
```

If Claude needs the full content, it simply calls `omni_retrieve("a1b2c3d4")` via MCP and gets everything back. **Zero information loss, guaranteed.**

## Custom TOML Filters

Extend OMNI for your company's internal tools without writing code:

```toml
# ~/.omni/filters/deploy.toml
schema_version = 1

[filters.deploy]
description = "Company deploy tool"
match_command = "^deploy\\b"
strip_ansi = true

[[filters.deploy.match_output]]
pattern = "Deployment successful"
message = "deploy: ✓ success"

strip_lines_matching = ["^\\[DEBUG\\]", "^Waiting"]
max_lines = 30

[[tests.deploy]]
name = "strips debug lines"
input = """
[DEBUG] Connecting...
Deployment successful
"""
expected = "deploy: ✓ success"
```

Test your filters: `omni learn --verify`

See [docs/FILTERS.md](docs/FILTERS.md) for the complete filter writing guide.

```

For individual checks during development:
```bash
cargo build          # Build the binary
cargo test           # Run all 147 tests
cargo insta review   # Review and accept snapshot changes
```
