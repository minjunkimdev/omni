## [0.3.9] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **`omni update`**: Check for the latest release from GitHub and get smart update instructions (auto-detects Homebrew vs installer).
- **`omni uninstall`**: Clean removal of `~/.omni` directory and automatic cleanup of MCP configs from Antigravity, Claude Code CLI, and Claude Desktop.
- **AI PR Describer**: Added `.github/workflows/ai-pr-describer.yml` for automated pull request descriptions.

### Fixed
- **Homebrew Upgrade Stability**: `omni setup` now uses stable `/opt/omni` paths instead of versioned `/Cellar/omni/X.X.X` paths, preventing broken symlinks after `brew upgrade`.
- **Self-referencing Symlink**: `omni setup` now skips symlinking when source and destination are the same path.
- **Dynamic Versioning**: `build.zig` now defaults to the current release version instead of "development" when `-Dversion` is not specified.

### Changed
- **Release script**: Now synchronizes **9 locations** (added `core/build.zig` default version).
- Simplified `.github/pull_request_template.md` to checklist-only format.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Version Synchronization**: All 8 versioned files now fully synchronized (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `core/build.zig.zon`, `src/index.ts`, `src/index.js`, `scripts/omni-deploy-edge.sh`, `docs/index.html`, `omni.rb`).
- **Release Automation**: `omni-release.sh` updated to handle docs and deploy script versioning.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Telemetry System**: Every `omni distill` and MCP call now records usage to `~/.omni/telemetry.csv`.
- **Expanded `omni report`**: Daily, Weekly, and Monthly breakdown tables with token savings (Cmds, Input, Output, Saved, Save%, Time).
- **Agent Filtering**: `omni report --agent=claude-code` to view per-agent metrics.
- **Agent Tagging**: `omni generate` now includes `--agent=<name>` in MCP config for automatic tracking.
- **PR Template**: Added `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

### Fixed
- **`omni setup` symlink**: Now searches 4 candidate paths for `index.js` and removes stale symlinks before creating new ones.
- **Installer (`install.sh`)**: Fixed color formatting (`%b`), version passing (`-Dversion`), and quoting issues.
- **Homebrew formula**: Replaced `post_install` with `caveats` to avoid sandbox issues with `$HOME`.

### Changed
- **Release script**: `omni-release.sh` now auto-bumps `build.zig.zon` and `package.json` versions.
- Removed `ARCHITECTURE.md` link from `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/index.html`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Unified Native CLI**: Replaced shell scripts with high-performance native subcommands.
- Subcommands: `omni distill`, `omni density`, `omni report`, `omni bench`, `omni generate`, `omni setup`.
- **Agent Templates**: Support for generating Antigravity and Claude Code input templates.
- **Zig Build System**: Fully integrated `build.zig` for cross-platform native and Wasm builds.

### Changed
- Moved all legacy shell scripts to `scripts/legacy/`.
- Updated `install.sh` to use the native build pipeline.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Zig 0.15.2 IO API transition: Replaced removed `std.io.getStdOut/getStdIn` with `std.fs.File` equivalents.
- Native build failure on Homebrew environment.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-15

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-15

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-14
