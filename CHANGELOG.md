## [0.3.7] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Telemetry System**: Every `omni distill` and MCP call now records usage to `~/.omni/telemetry.csv`.
- **Expanded `omni report`**: Daily, Weekly, and Monthly breakdown tables with token savings (Cmds, Input, Output, Saved, Save%, Time).
- **Agent Filtering**: `omni report --agent=claude-code` to view per-agent metrics.
- **Agent Tagging**: `omni generate` now includes `--agent=<name>` in MCP config for automatic tracking.
- **PR Template**: Added `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

### Fixed
- **`omni setup` symlink**: Now searches 4 candidate paths for `index.js` and removes stale symlinks before creating new ones.
- **Installer (`install.sh`)**: Fixed color formatting (`%b`), version passing (`-Dversion`), and quoting issues.
- **Homebrew formula**: Replaced `post_install` with `caveats` to avoid sandbox issues with `$HOME`.
